# TMA-Camera
This project consists of 2 parts:
  - Creating a model that by learning from the  traffic generated by an IP Camera has the objective of predicting if there is movement or not.
  - An Application that by using the odel tells in real-time whether the camera is sending images with movement or not.

## Install requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Execute Real Time Application
```python3 App/app.py <IP> <IntervalOfCapture> <dirToStoreCaptures>```
i.e ```python3 App/app.py 192.168.4.5 10 App/data/captures/```

We need to download the model from this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10i2K28URexs3HI7rwC8JLLDzXh06ULJg/view?usp=sharing And then move it to TMA-Camera\Keras\ModeloCNN\models\save

We need to do this because GitHub does not allow us to upload files with certain size

## How to capture data?
```
python captureDataCamera.py <camera_ip> <num_it> <time> <mov/no_mov>
i.e. python captureDataCamera.py 192.168.4.5 1 10 0
```

## How to process data?
```
python3 generateCSV.py <dir_data> <camera_ip>
i.e. python3 generateCSV.py data/ 192.168.4.5
```
